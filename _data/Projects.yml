      - Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) developed based on a large language model, under the supervision of AI Scientist at Apple- [Dr. Aamer Zaheer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aamerzaheer/)
      - Mimicked the facial expressions of the agent according to the expression of the voice

  - title: "Jump Point Search"
    description: 
      - In pursuit of solving the latency problem in finding paths in AA games complex 2D grid maps, engineered a new algorithm optimizing the A* algorithm by carefully only exploring those nodes which could be turning or jump points.  
      - On the grid of 10,000 * 10,000, Jump Point Search (JPS) is two magnitudes faster than A*. And it is solving big real-time latency problems in many projects.

  - title: "Boids" 
    description: 
      - Implemented a life program simulating the behavior of a flock of birds, school of fishes, or herd of land animals designed by Craig Reynolds in his paper '[Flocks, Herds, and Schools A Distributed Behavioral Model (1986)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/37402.37406)'. The Program adds behaviors of Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion in NPCs.
